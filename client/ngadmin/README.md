We put a lot of efforts to bring together latest and the most trending web design approaches, while creating this template.
Every color, character or image was carefully selected by our team to provide the best experience possible.
We're very proud of it and like it very much. We also hope that you will enjoy it as well.

It's just a first version, but we will continue development of this template to create not just another bootstrap customization, but the whole HTML framework that can be applied in a lot of places.
